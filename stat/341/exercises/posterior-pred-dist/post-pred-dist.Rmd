## Definitions

- A model is **generative** if you can simulate hypothetical data samples from it. Many frequentist models, and basically all Bayesian ones, are generative.
- Obtaining a **posterior predictive distribution** means simulating data for all conjectured values of your parameter(s), then computing an average of all the simulated data distributions weighted by the posterior probability/density. In other words, *sample* parameter values from the posterior and simulate some data for each one, aggregating all the simulated data together at the end.

#### Question: Discuss why and how the two definitions of "posterior predictive distribution" are equivalent.

The two are equivalent because simulating data for all conjectured values of your parameters are the same with sample parameter values from the posterior. The other two analogy are the same too just different words. 
 
#### Question: The figure below is Figure 3.6 from *Statistical Rethinking,* illustrating how to obtain a posterior predictive distribution. 

How would you label the y axis of each plot? 

What process is happening to get from the Posterior Probability to the Sampling Distributions? 

What process is happening to get from the Sampling Distributions to the Posterior Predictive Distribution?

Graph 1: y: Density(plausibility)

How likely does the water to be (6 or 7)

Graph 2: Simulating data with p = 0.1, 0.2, ...

x: number if water samples or number of successes in 9 trials)
y: number of samples set of 9 trials

Graph 3: Averaging the sampling distributions, the thickness is more heavier. 

y: number of samples set of 9 trials.

## Simulate Data Given Parameter

*The code below is for the book's "proportion water on the Earth" example. Please change it so it's relevant to the "blood" example OR the "product patent" example.*

```{r}
B <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 9, prob = 0.71)
glimpse(B)
```

Things to know and consider:

- (Replace the crossed-out text with an explanation that's true for your blood or patent example) Our model says that it's a fair approximation to say that observations of whether a randomly-chosen ~~point on the globe is land or water~~ are like draws from a binomial distribution, and we are trying to estimate the probability of ~~any one "trial" or chosen point on the globe being water~~.
- The **posterior** gives us our "answer" -- the estimate of the probability ~~of water~~.
- `rbinom()` is a function that produces *random samples* from a binomial distribution. The inputs are `n`, the number of random samples you want; `size`, the number of *trials* making up each sample; and `prob`, the probability of getting a "success."
- So...how did we choose the `n` to be 10,000? 

Why is the `size` 9? 

I think its because the total number of the data was 9

And how was 0.71 picked as the `prob`? *Hint: there's a problem with just using 0.71!)*

Maybe because out of 9 data, the 71% of it was number of success.

- Why was the output called `W` and what might you call it in your (blood or patent) example?

#### Question: What's the problem with using a single value for `prob`, if our goal is to simulate data that are consistent with our model conclusions? 

Since there is 10000 number of inputs, one of the problem could be that 


## Posterior Predictive Distribution

To get the posterior predictive distribution, we do just as above to simulate data given a *single* parameter value. Except now, we do simulation for a *whole set of parameter values sampled from the posterior.*

*The code below is for the book's "proportion water on the Earth" example. Alter it so it's relevant to the "blood" example OR the "product patent" example. Note, you may need to add code to this Rmd so that you have a fitted model to draw posterior samples from.*

```{r}
# add code here to: 1) fit your model and 2) generate post_samples, a sample from the posterior, from it
# uncomment this code when ready to run (it will not run until post_samples exists!)
# W_ppd <- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 9, prob = post_samples)
# glimpse(W)
```

```{r fit-model}
quap_blood <- quap(
  alist(
    B ~ dbinom( B+F , p),  # binomial likelihood 
    p ~ dunif(0 , 1)        # **uniform** prior for the probability of success, "p"
  ), 
  data = list(B = 3, F = 6)
)
```

```{r generate-post-sample-from-posterior}
set.seed(75)
quap_post_samp <- sample.qa.posterior(quap_blood,
                                      n = 10000)

glimpse(quap_post_samp)
```
```{r posterior predictive distribution}
B_ppd <- rbinom(n = 10000, 
                size = 9,  #total number of successes plus failures.
                prob = quap_post_samp$p)

glimpse(B_ppd)
```
