These are where almost all of the parameters go in a network. (Some architectures use a variant called a *convolutional* layer.) At its core, a linear layer does a bunch of *dot product*s between its *input* vector and its (learned) *weight* vectors.\n\nA few intuitions to understand what a dot product is:\n\n1. It measures *similarity*, in the sense of *alignment*. The following statements loosely capture it:\n    - \"How much does the input look like *this*?\"\n    - \"How big is the input in *this* direction?\"\n    - \"How aligned is the input with this direction?\"\n    - \"What's the cosine of the angle between the input vector and this vector?\"\n2. A bunch of dot products all together (like in a Linear layer) *rotates and stretches* the input space, like moving a camera around a scene.\n3. It's how a multiple linear regression computes its output: a weighted mixture of each part of its input.\n\nRecall that we can make a line by an expression like `y = w*x + b`. (Some of you may remember *mx+b* , but we'll use *w* for the *weight(s)* instead.)\n\nThat's a multiplication followed by a sum. We can extend that to lots of *x*'s, each of which needs a corresponding *w*:\n\n`y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wN*xN + b`\n\nFor simplicity, let's start by ignoring the `b`ias.  So we're left with\n\n`y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wN*xN`\n\nthat is, multiply each number in `w` by its corresponding number in `x` and add up the results: `sum(w[i] * x[i] for i in range(N))`. Or, in mathematical notation: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i x_i.$\n\nThe result is called a *dot product*, and is one of the fundamental operations in linear algebra. At this point you don't need to understand all the linear algebra part of this, we're just implementing a common calculation.\n\nLet's do that in pure Python, and then in PyTorch.
